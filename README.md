# Running the Backend Locally

## Steps to Clone and Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nnarciss98/E-commerce-Webshop.git webshop
   cd webshop
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database:**
    - Ensure you have a running instance of a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
      - In Webshop utils you have the necessary docker files to create the container, to do so run this:
          ```bash 
          docker build -t webapp_postgres .
          docker-compose up -d
          ```
    - Update the `application.yml` file with your database credentials.

   Example configuration:
   ```yml
    spring:
        datasource:
            url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/webshop
            username: user
            password: supersecretpassword
            driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
        jpa:
            database: postgresql
            database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
            hibernate:
                ddl-auto: create-drop
   ```

3. **Build the Project:**
   Make sure you have Maven installed. Then, build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   You can run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   Alternatively, you can run the generated JAR file:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/webshop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

5. **Access the API:**
    - The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
    - Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the endpoints.
